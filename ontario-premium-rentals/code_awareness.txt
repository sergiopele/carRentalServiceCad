Hero Section Update (Dubai-style)
Date: July 7, 2025

Affected Files:
- Hero.jsx
- Hero.css

Purpose:
Redesigned the hero section to visually resemble the Dubai tourism website layout â€” featuring a full-screen background image, right-aligned overlay content with heading, description, and call-to-action button. The layout adapts responsively across desktop and mobile views.

Key Changes:
1. Background Image
   - Moved hero image from <img> tag to CSS background on `.hero-section`.
   - Ensures full-width, full-height coverage using `background: url(...) center center / cover no-repeat`.

2. Layout Structure
   - Changed `.hero-section` to use `display: flex; justify-content: flex-end` for desktop layout.
   - Positioned `.hero-overlay` to the right and vertically centered.
   - On mobile, content is centered using media queries.

3. Overlay Content Box
   - New `.hero-overlay` class introduced to wrap content.
   - Uses `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)` and `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` for glassmorphism.
   - Includes padding, max-width, and border-radius for aesthetic layout.

4. Typography
   - Updated heading (`h1`) and paragraph (`p`) styling for better visibility and spacing.
   - Applied modern font settings and line height for improved readability.

5. CTA Button
   - Converted to white background, black text style with hover transition.
   - Ensured responsive alignment: left-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile.

6. Mobile Responsiveness
   - On screens <768px:
     - `.hero-section` layout changes to center content.
     - `.hero-overlay` becomes full width with increased padding.
     - Typography scales down for small screens.
     - Image remains full-screen background.

Implementation Notes:
- To change the hero background image, update the CSS line in `.hero-section`:
  background: url('/your-image.png') center center / cover no-repeat;

- You may further tweak the blur strength or overlay background opacity depending on image clarity.

Result:
A visually appealing and responsive hero section that mirrors a modern landing page aesthetic with strong visual impact on both desktop and mobile.
